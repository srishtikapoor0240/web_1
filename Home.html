                <p>Welcome to my website—yes, I actually made this instead of taking a nap, which already says a lot
                    about my
                    life choices. Think of this place as a curated museum of my existence, except without the overpriced
                    tickets
                    and painfully slow audio guides. Here, you’ll find my projects, ideas, and the occasional spark of
                    genius
                    that usually appears at 3 AM when I’m clearly supposed to be doing something responsible. I built
                    this site
                    partly to showcase my work, partly to convince myself that I am, in fact, a productive human being,
                    and
                    mostly because procrastinating feels less illegal when you make it look aesthetic.
                    <br><br>
                    So go ahead, explore, judge, admire, question your own life decisions—whatever feels right. I hope
                    this
                    little corner of the internet makes you smile, laugh, or at least say “wow, same.” Thanks for
                    stopping by…
                    and yes, I fully accept applause, compliments, and snacks. </p>
