        <p> Hi, I’m Srishti — the person who somehow decided that building a whole website was a good idea despite
            having a perfectly functional habit of procrastinating. When I’m not pretending to have my life together,
            I’m usually diving into projects, reading things I’ll overthink later, or dancing like no one’s recording
            (hopefully). I love learning new skills, especially the ones I definitely didn’t ask for but life decided to
            throw at me. This space is basically a collection of my experiments, ideas, and occasional strokes of
            brilliance… mixed with a generous dose of chaos. Enjoy exploring, and try not to judge—I’m still figuring it
            out one “What am I even doing?” at a time. Thank you for being here and showing interest in learning more
            about me!
        </p>
