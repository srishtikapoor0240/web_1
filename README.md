# Web Development Practice (web_1)
This folder contains my daily practice work while learning web development. 
It includes small web pages, UI experiments, and mini implementations created to understand core web concepts and how different pages can be linked together.

## What This Folder Contains
- Practice HTML pages
- Basic CSS styling experiments
- JavaScript functionality trials
- Page navigation and linking between multiple web pages
- Layout and structure experiments
## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to document my learning journey in web development.
Each file represents a concept or feature I practiced, helping me build a strong foundation through hands-on experimentation.
